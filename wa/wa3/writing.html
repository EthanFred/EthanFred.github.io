                <h2> Im Still Here</h2>
                <p> I wrote the narrative that I then directed! I researched a lot about what happens to the brain when someone is dying, and implemented that into the film.</p>

                <h2> Howling </h2>
                <p> I wrote Howling based off a song by Noah Kahan. It is one of my favorite works! </p>

                <h2>  Fractured Sand</h2>
                <p> This was a film I wrote dealing with a character about to commit suicide. Its more abstract and I had a lot of fun dealing with the different things.</p>
