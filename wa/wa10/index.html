      <h1> Extension </h1>
      <p> For this project, I used NewsData.io as the API and for the extension from the in class assignment. </p>
      <p> I used an API key with Node JS to hide it in the backend. </p>
      <p> To run this webpage, in the terminal inside the wa10 folder, you have to run: </p>
      <p> npm install </p>
      <p> node backend.js </p>
      <p> This starts the server and will allow you to move cycle the different news articles</p>
      <h1> Implemtation </h1>
      <p> 
        For my systems critique project, I want to use this API to go through recipes and return results 
        that are biased towards a more positive rating. This API allows for such. I would also show the image 
        and more infomration for the user using Grid in css, so it is easy to go through these different articles.
        One thing I have to note is that I have to pay to find random articles, so I can only search for the latest 
        articles, and could not randomly find an article in the archive. If I were to fully implement it, I would make 
        some randomization so it is not just the most recent articles.
