            <h3> Family Therapy</h3>
            <p> A documentary about my relationship with my family as my brother went through a severe depression.</p> 

            <h3> Zoey </h3>
            <p> A film I made about my dog who was diagnosed with cancer. It was about living in the moment, appreciating it, and dealing with loss.</p> 
            <p> this film uses the strong juxtaposition of sound and image to provide a jarring and uncomfortable experience. </p>

            <h3>  Im Still Here</h3>
            <p> In this narrative film, a man dies and must deal with his mortality in his final moments.</p>
