                    <h3> Unreal Engine</h3>
                    <p> I have a lot of experience messing with nanite technology and the realism that Unreal Engine 5 offers</p> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Unity </h3>
                    <p> I love Unity for its accessibility and how it integrates mechanics into the engine</p> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Godot </h3>

                    <h3> Lazer map </h3>
                    <p> I created a realistic "temple explorer" in which the player bounces lazers across an Unreal Engine environment</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3> Mafia </h3>
                    <p> I created a game similar to Mafia in which the player moves around the environment and tries to talk to NPCs and get on their goodside, otherwise they will be killed. </p>

            <h2> Current Project </h2>
            <p> I am currently working on a game in which you interact with 10 npcs, every night a person is selected to kill another. Its a game that requires a lot of choice!
